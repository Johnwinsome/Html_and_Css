							1.8 HTML Attributes
   						       ---------------------

- Charset is an attribute for a meta element. Most attributes have a value assigned to them. In this example, charset is assigned thevalue
   "utf-8". Although most attributes have a value assigned to them, some do not.

- A string is a group of zero or morecharacters surrounded by a pair of double quotes (“) or a pair of single quotes (‘), with double
  quotes preferred.

- Attributes are more common with void elements, but they can be used with container elements as well. 

- The lang attribute tells the browser that the element is using a particular language for its content. For web pages written in English, 
   use <html lang="en">.

-The W3C’s Internationalization Activity group provides quite a few good reasons, and here are a few of them:

	   ▸ Help search engines find web pages that use a particular language.
	   ▸ Help spell-checker and grammar-checker tools work more effectively.
	   ▸ Help browsers use appropriate fonts.
	   ▸ Help speech synthesizers pronounce words correctly 

## meta charset Element

   - Syntax refers to the punctuation rules for code. Semantics refers to the meaning of the code. First up—the semantics for the meta 
     charset element.

   - For web page transmissions, the meta charset element specifies the encoding scheme. Normally, you should use a charset value of “utf-8”
      because all modern browsers understand that value.

   - The encoding scheme is sometimes referred to as a character set, and that’s what charset stands for. If you omit the meta charset element,
     your web page will usually work because most browsers assume UTF-8 encoding by default. But don’t count on the default.

## meta name Element

   - Most of the meta elements use the name attribute to specify the type of information that’s being provided. Common values for the meta name 
     attribute are author, description, and keywords. The name and content attributes go together. The name attribute’s value specifies the type
     of thing that the content attribute’s value specifies. 

   - The meta description element and also the meta keywords element help web search engines find your web page. In addition, the meta description 
     element helps the person reading the code learn the purpose of the web page. The meta description element isn’t as important as the meta author
     and meta charset elements.
